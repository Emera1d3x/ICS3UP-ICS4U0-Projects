            <h2 style="font-size: 400%; text-align: center;">Over this past semester, I have made a further effort
                to improve my technical and coding skills. 
                Outside of ICS4 programming, these are some things I did:

        <h1 style="font-size: 350%; padding-left: 45px;">Competitive Programming</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 140%; padding-left: 45px; padding-right: 45px;">Over the last couple months I have gained
            a lot of interest in competitive programming and hope 
            to continue improving. I feel like doing these types of 
            questions actually made me better at writing code quickly, 
            which has been very helpful for all the AP free responses.

        <p style="font-size: 140%; padding-left: 45px; padding-right: 45px;">
            To begin with, the most important thing I did with this subtopic was
            doing CCC this year. I was very disappointed by my results
            and I feel like with the progress I am making, if I stay 
            consistent in my learning I can probably get HRs next year
            for seniors.

            Problem 1: <a href="https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc24j1" target="_blank"> Junior 1 DMOJ Link</a>
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 140%; padding-left: 45px; padding-right: 45px;">
            My solution: Just get inputs for each meal cost, and substitute it
            in simple mathmatical equation. During contest: (15/15)
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 190%; padding-left: 45px; padding-right: 45px; font-style: italic;">
            Problem 2: <a href="https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc24j2" target="_blank"> Junior 2 DMOJ Link</a>
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 140%; padding-left: 45px; padding-right: 45px;">
            My solution: Because there is a guaranteed "Yobi"
            that can kill the "Dusa", I just made a while loop
            that keeps making the Dusa size variable bigger by current
            Yobi size
            until it encounters a bigger Yobi, in which case I print
            Dusa size and stop loop. During contest: (15/15)
        </p>

            Problem 3: <a href="https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc24j3" target="_blank"> Junior 3 DMOJ Link</a>
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 140%; padding-left: 45px; padding-right: 45px;">
            My solution: Make a for loop getting the first place
            score, second place score, and third place score. During the contest
            I knew my loops did not do the job correctly
            and I couldn't be bothered to waste time making a clean 
            solution so I just copy and pasted the same 
            loop 3 times so it is guaranteed to be accurate. Finally
            I looped over the array again to find the amount of people who had 
            the third place score and printed out the output. During contest:

            Problem 4: <a href="https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc24j4" target="_blank"> Junior 4 DMOJ Link</a>
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 140%; padding-left: 45px; padding-right: 45px;">
            My solution: Because of a lapse in judgement and me forgetting
            that string.equals is a o(n) method, my entire solution was 
            o(n^2) thus only leading to partial marks. Basically just
            loop over the array and kind of simulate what the keys would 
            display, and compare it with the actual displayed string to ensure 
            you have the silly key and quiet key correct.

            Problem 5: <a href="https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc24j5" target="_blank"> Junior 5 DMOJ Link</a>
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 140%; padding-left: 45px; padding-right: 45px;">
            My solution: Here is where things get dicey. During the contest I had
            a very similar implementation to what I have now 
            (I recognized that I could literally use the same implementation
            I use for other DMOJ problems that use a 2D array for 
            graph theory - my solution for J5 last year is very similar
            to this year's)
            , however my method may have not marked nodes
            correctly thus
            leading to the comical and very annoying stack overflow error.
            After I had already spent like 50 minutes trying to debug the code,
            I decided to fall back on the easy 1st subtask (where no haybales exists) but
            I ended up naming 2 variables the same thing thus failing.
            During the contest: (0/15) ;-; very unhappy, I will get vengence
            next year.
            My solution after the contest: Recursively call a method that 
            attempts to move the farmer up, down, left and right. If not possible
            (haybale is in the way or out of grid), return, essentially stopping 
            that branch or "stream" of simulation (just a flood fill).
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 140%; padding-left: 45px; padding-right: 45px;">
            I didn't do seniors this year but will next year. So far I have 
            done S1 and S2, and I have an idea for S3 but am yet to 
            implement this in code.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 190%; padding-left: 45px; padding-right: 45px; font-style: italic;">
            Problem 1: <a href="https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc24s1" target="_blank"> Senior 1 DMOJ Link</a>
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 140%; padding-left: 45px; padding-right: 45px;">
            My solution: Read first half of array and store info in an array.
            Read second part of array and compare with stored array. Keep track 
            of similarities.
        </p>

            Problem 2: <a href="https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc24s2" target="_blank"> Senior 2 DMOJ Link</a>
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 140%; padding-left: 45px; padding-right: 45px;">
            My solution: For each line, go through array once to 
            contain heavy letters in a hashmap as (letter: true), and light 
            letters as (letter:false).
            Then go over loop again and see if it is alternating.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 190%; padding-left: 45px; padding-right: 45px; font-style: italic;">
            Problem 3: <a href="https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc24s3" target="_blank"> Senior 3 DMOJ Link</a>
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 140%; padding-left: 45px; padding-right: 45px;">
            I haven't done this yet but I think I have the right idea.
            Basically first loop over the array from left to right. If the 
            order of numbers match the ones in the target, then it is possible to
            swipe. For implementation just go from left to right or right to left
            swipping as you go.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 140%; padding-left: 45px; padding-right: 45px;">
            (P.S I solved this Rubik's Cube implementation problem which
            I think was created by an old student of yours (NinjaClasher?):
            <a href="https://dmoj.ca/problem/evanscube"> Evan's Cube</a> )
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 140%; padding-left: 45px; padding-right: 45px;">
            For my solution I just hard coded simulating what moves 
            look like and comparing stickers or a side to the center 
            sticker.

        <p style="font-size: 140%; padding-left: 45px; padding-right: 45px;">
            Manim is a python library created by a mathmatical youtuber
            called 3Blue1Brown - he taught me the basics
            to calculus. The code allows 
            for the creation of objects that get generated in a video format.
            This was the way I created the Bubble Sort Walkthrough Video
            for the Sorting Presentation. Here is the code that I used:

        <p style="font-size: 140%; padding-left: 45px; padding-right: 45px;">
            Overall it was a really cool experience working
            with Python when I haven't touched it in years, especially
            working with a cool extension that makes visuals.
