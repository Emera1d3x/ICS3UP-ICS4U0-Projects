        <h1 style="font-size: 350%; padding-left: 45px; padding-right: 45px;">Overarching Goals</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 140%; padding-left: 45px; padding-right: 45px;"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  My overarching goal is to one day get a job where
            I can create really cool things which provide services
            that real people can use and enjoy. I would want the job
            to not be too easy - making me lazy and lose my skills,
            but obviously not too hard - no one wants
            to be stressed 24/7. <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Right now I believe I can 
            fullfill this life purpose through the vast subject of technology, 
            my favourite topic. Technology and 
            programming really seem to 
            be a culmination of my favourite things. I love creating
             art (whether its tryharding too much for an
            english media assignment or creating posters for Robotics Club) 
            and "tinkering my creative brain",
            hey look technology
            implements this with online-art (something which I have been
            doing for a very long time) and
            programming sometimes does this with UI! I love being competitive
            and solving problems (the dopamine 
            boost is too much), hey look, there's competitive programming! 
            <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There are tons of more things I enjoy and programming always
            seems to have a piece of it! Because of this 
            right now I've mentally commited myself to work towards the 
            goal of going into a reputable university to further
            expand my knowledge and experience.

        <h1 style="font-size: 350%; padding-left: 45px; padding-right: 45px;">Future Goals</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 150%; padding-left: 45px; padding-right: 45px;"> Some goals in the near future I have are:
        </p>
        <ul style="font-size: 140%; padding-left: 125px; padding-right: 45px;">
            <li> Ensure that my ICS4 grade is as high as it can be</li>
            <li> Don't throw ICS</li>
            <li> Refine my skills in Math, I've fallen off big time</li>
            <li> Fully learn more mathematical concepts such as 
                permutations, combinatorics, and geometry
            </li>
            <li> Prepare for my grade 11 year CEMC contests. (Hopefully I can 
                atleast make honour rolls, I threw this years
                Junior contest so hard that I'm still salty ;-;)
                for all CEMC contests I genuinly believe its possible for me
                to do well. It feels 
                like for every contest I just barely miss the mark,
                all I need to do is not rush and slowly build up my
                understanding for concepts that in realitiy can be easy if I 
                gamify them.
            </li>
            <li>
                Do well in CCC
            </li>
            <li>
                Do well in Fermat 
            </li>
            <li>
                Do well in Hypatia  
            </li>
            <li>
                Do well in Euclid (at this point im trying to type these goals into existence)
            </li>
            <li> Fully learn C++, I've already started learning from a book
                and did some practice with DMOJ. I plan on resuming 
                my practice after ICS40 because I don't want to magically 
                forget Java syntax within weeks for the exam.
            </li>
            <li> Get better with Manim, a great tool. More about that
                in Programming+
            </li>
            <li> Get better with HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT.
                Making this portfolio - although stressfull, was also 
                pretty fun. I plan on making a website for 
                Robotics Club - a way to showcase the skills that
                I (hopefully) have with fullstack developing (and my
                contributions to Robotics Club), and maybe
                revamp this website to be more suitable.
            </li>
            <li> "Git" good with github
            </li>
            <li> Be more involved with Mackenzie Clubs, develop 
                some leadership skills and try finding some sort of 
                involvement outside of school
            </li>
        </ul>
